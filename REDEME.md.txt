Deploy a cluster of EC2 Instances in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The ELB listens on port 80 and distributes load across the EC2 Instances, each of which runs the same "Hello, World" web server.


Quick start
Note: These examples deploy resources into your AWS account. 

Install Terraform.
Set your AWS credentials as the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
cd into one of the example folders.
Run terraform init.
Run terraform apply.
After it's done deploying, the example will output URLs or IPs you can try out.
To clean up and delete all resources after you're done, run terraform destroy.


curl http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
Hello, World

Note: In-order to link root url as display 'Hello World, we can implement route53 DNS to have something like www.Helloworld.com
